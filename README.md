# Stella

Hey there! Welcome to Stella, a barebones, minimalistic implementation of a bot built in [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js).

## Requirements
* Command Line Utility & Knowledge
    * Basically, you need to know how to navigate around a command line with commands like `cd` and `ls`.
    * If you're on a Windows computer, it is highly recommended to use a utility like [ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io/) or [Cmder](http://cmder.net/)
* [Node.js - Latest LTS Version](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* A sense of humour
* A good soul

## Getting Started
We'll get right into the nitty gritty...

AT A LATER DATE CAUSE I'M LAZY RIGHT NOW.
